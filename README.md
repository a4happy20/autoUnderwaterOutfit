**#Description:**
  Python script for anime game to add auto outfit changing when under or in water. It will follow this logic. When entering water we store current outfit($swapvar value) and set the underwater outfit($UnderwaterOutfitSelect value). When leaving the water we set it back to the stored outfit($swapvar value). You can choose a toggle to enable/disable the functionality. If you have more than one underwater outfit you can set a key to cycle through outfits.

  1. Place in the directory of the INI you want to adjust.
  2.) Run the script and you will be prompted to choose how many underwater outfits you have.
  3. Next you will have to choose what $swapvar values to use for the outfits.
  4. You will then be able to set a toggle key to enable/disable the functionality.
  5. If you have more than one underwater outfit you will be asked to set a key for switching the outfits.
  6. Now you can choose if you want the underwater outfits to be available only underwater and not on land.
